# AI/ML Workshop Project 📊🤖

## Overview
This project was created during an interactive **AI/ML Workshop** session where we explored the basics of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning as a career path.

The workshop introduced us to **Python** as a powerful and beginner-friendly programming language widely used in AI/ML because of its vast ecosystem of libraries.

---

## What We Learned
During the session, we gained exposure to key Python libraries used in data science, such as:

- **NumPy** – for numerical computing  
- **Pandas** – for data handling and analysis  
- **Matplotlib** – for data visualization  
- **Seaborn** – for advanced plotting and graphs  

---

## Project Task
As a hands-on activity, we were given a dataset (database-style data) and were required to:

- Perform queries and data filtering  
- Analyze the dataset using Python  
- Visualize results by plotting graphs in **Jupyter Notebook**

The goal was to understand how data can be transformed into meaningful insights through visualization.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## Output
The project generates graphical insights from the dataset using Python queries and plotting libraries.

---

## Future Scope
This workshop project was a starting point, and in the future it can be extended into:

- Full exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model training
- Real-world dataset integration
